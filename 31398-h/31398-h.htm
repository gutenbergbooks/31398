<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>A LEADER FROM A FOREIGN NEWSPAPER: THE NEW RUSSIAN MANIFESTO.</h3>

  <p>Mention was recently made, in Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;218., of the valuable
  character of many of the leading articles in the continental journals,
  and a wish expressed that translations of them were more frequently
  communicated in our own papers to English readers. The great newspapers
  of this country are too rich in varied talent and worldwide resources of
  their own, to make it worth their while in ordinary times to pay much
  attention to information and disquisition from foreign politicians, on
  subjects of the day; but the infinite importance to England, and to the
  world, of the present warlike struggle, renders it a matter of
  corresponding weight to know how far the foreign press, in the great
  centres of movement and intelligence, stand affected to Great Britain.
  Perhaps, therefore, as a specimen of this kind of writing, you will for
  once admit, among your varied contents, the following article from the
  <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> of May 4:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"While in England, as a preparation for war, a day of humiliation and
  prayer is held, on which the Clergy exhort the people to look into their
  own breasts, and to discover and forsake those sins which might provoke
  God's punishments; while the most powerful nation of the world commences
  war by humbling itself before God, on the part of Russia a new manifesto
  appears, the arrogance of which can scarcely be exceeded by anything
  human. The Czar speaks as if he were the representative of God upon
  earth. His affair is God's affair. He carries on war for God, and for His
  only begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Saviour. God is for him, who can be
  against him!</p>

  <p>"Such a document has not proceeded from the cabinet of any European
  power since the Middle Ages. It exceeds all which even Russian diplomacy
  has accomplished, in its zeal for Christianity, during the last century.
  For it is worthy of notice that nowhere is religion so much publicly
  talked about, as in the place where least of it remains, among the higher
  classes in St. Petersburgh. Religion there is <i>inter instrumenta
  regni</i>. When Catherine II. permitted her husband Peter III. to be
  imprisoned, in order to rob him of his throne and life, the cause of this
  was communicated to the Russian people on July 9, 1762, as
  follows:&mdash;'First of all, the foundation of your orthodox Greek
  religion has been shaken and its principles are drawing near to a total
  overthrow; so that we ought to dread exceedingly lest we should see a
  change in the true ruling faith transmitted from antiquity in Russia, and
  a foreign religion introduced.' So wrote Catherine II., 'the greatest of
  the queens, and of the &mdash;&mdash;,' the friend of Voltaire, the
  greatest lady-freethinker of her age. But she wrote still
  farther:&mdash;'Secondly, the honour of Russia as a state, which has been
  brought to the highest pinnacle of her victorious arms with the loss of
  so much blood, is actually trodden under foot through the newly-concluded
  peace <i>with her bitterest enemy</i>.' And who is this bitterest enemy
  of the orthodox Russia? The King of Prussia, Frederick II.! Yes, the King
  of Prussia was once declared to be the bitterest enemy of orthodox
  Russia; and nothing stands in the way but at some future time he may
  again be declared to be so, just as at the decree of the incorporation of
  the provinces of Preutzen and Posen. The politicians of St. Petersburgh
  know that the Russian people, living on in animal dulness, are
  susceptible of no other intellectual impression except a religious one;
  and so without reflection, the cross is torn from the high altar, and
  used as a military signal. Religion was employed as a pretext, in order
  to lead the unhappy Poles step by step into ruin; and Russia was just so
  employed in Turkey, when the 'heathen' undertook to disturb her in her
  Christian work. Rise up, therefore, orthodox nation, and fight for the
  true Christian faith!</p>

  <p>"We know not whether such a manifesto is sufficient to lead the
  Russians willingly, like a devoutly believing flock, in the name of Jesus
  Christ to the battle-field; and to perish in a war projected for a
  worldly purpose, to obtain the inheritance of the 'sick man.' But we do
  know that the manifesto will make no one believe throughout civilised
  Europe in Russia's holy views. Nations which have learned to think cannot
  help immediately perceiving the contradiction which prevails in this
  manifesto. First of all the struggle is represented as religious, and
  immediately after as political. 'England and France' it says, 'make war
  on Russia, in order to deprive her of a part of her territory.' The only
  logical connexion between the two modes of statement consists in the
  words&mdash;'their object is to cause our fatherland to descend from the
  powerful position to which the hand of the Almighty has raised it.' And
  thereupon is mentioned 'the holy purpose which has been assigned to
  Russia by divine providence.' And this holy purpose has been no secret
  for a long time. 'According to the design of providence,' wrote Peter the
  Great, 'the Russian people are called to universal dominion over Europe
  for the future.'</p>

  <p>"Such a future cannot longer be averted from Europe, except by common
  efforts. Prussia has come to an understanding, as to the object in view,
  with the other powers; and when an object or purpose is sought to be
  attained, the means must also be provided. To make an impression by words
  and peaceful means, is quite out of the question, after this imperial
  pastoral letter, which proclaims war in the name of God and of Jesus
  Christ. Force can only he repelled by force. It was not our wish to
  compel our government prematurely. With reference to Prussia's position,
  the warlike interference of our troops was not desired until England and
  France had concluded a firm alliance between themselves, and with Turkey;
  and had commenced the war in earnest. Now, when all this has taken place,
  and the thunder of cannon is roaring over sea and land; now, when
  Austria, which conceals within herself so many more dangers, prepares,
  with manly determination, to advance; what excuse can Prussia <!-- Page
  464 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page464"></a>{464}</span>have,
  called upon by right to the leadership; what excuse can she make to
  herself for remaining behind? In the Vienna protocol of April 9, Prussia
  has pledged herself, beyond what we could have dared to hope, towards the
  Western Powers: in the treaty with Austria of April 20, Prussia has bound
  herself, in certain eventualities that may occur at any moment, to a
  warlike support of Austria. Is it not, therefore, high time for Prussia
  to arouse herself from her lethargy, in order to undertake the support
  contracted for by treaty? If history teaches anywhere an evident lesson,
  Prussia will find it in her own past history. Once before Prussia
  promised to help Austria, and was not able to perform her engagement. All
  the misfortune by which we were attacked in 1806 is to be ascribed to
  Prussia not having completed her preparations in 1805, and to her not
  appearing in the field before the battle of Austerlitz. It was reported
  lately to be the saying of a brave general, that when he heard the
  enemies' batteries firing, it always seemed to him that he heard his own
  name called out. Does not Prussia also hear her own name loudly
  pronounced, in those cannon-shots fired off in the Baltic and Black Sea
  for the public law of nations by Europe's brave champions? By what means
  did the great Elector establish the honour of the Prussian name, except
  by bravely taking the field, as a model of German princes, against the
  superior force of Louis XIV.? The policy, to which the Prussian
  government has again pledged itself, will be unanimously approved of by
  the Prussian people. The abuse which Russia has made of the name of
  Religion can deceive none, but such as are willing to be deceived.
  Catholic Christendom, with the Pope and the dignitaries of the Catholic
  Church in England and France at its head, have declared which side in
  this struggle is right, and which is wrong; and Righteousness is God's
  earthly name! Not less have the noblest and most pious Protestants loudly
  raised their voices as witnesses to the truth, and against the common
  oppressor of <i>every</i> Christian church, even his own; Religion,
  called upon for aid, denies it to Russia; and political science has long
  since pronounced her judgment, that Russia's superiority must be put an
  end to by a general opposition. If Prussia would but seize the
  opportunity, and proceed in the same path with Austria, Russia's ambition
  might be tamed by united Europe in one successful campaign. Now is the
  favourable moment for Prussia; and if it is not taken advantage of,
  generations unborn may have cause to rue it."</p>

<h3>THE LAUNCH OF THE "PRINCE ROYAL" IN 1610.</h3>

  <p>October 20, 1608, Mr. Phineas Pette commenced the "Prince Royal,"
  which was launched in 1610. The keel of this "most goodly shippe for
  warre" was 114 feet long, and the cross-beam 44 feet in length, and she
  carried three score and four pieces of great ordnance, and was of the
  burden of 1400 tons. On the 8th of May, 1609, the king presided at the
  trial of Pette at Woolwich for insufficiency, during which Pette sat on
  his knees, "baited by the great lord (Northampton) and his bandogs;" and
  after the ship had been inspected by the king and his party, Mr. Pette
  was acquitted of the charges brought against him. The prince visited the
  ship on the 30th of January, 1609, 25th of April, 18th of June, and again
  the following day, with the king, and on the 24th of September it was
  launched. It is stated that the garnishing of the ship began between
  Easter and Michaelmas, and that the number of nobles, gentry, and
  citizens, resorting continually to Woolwich to see it, was incredible. On
  the 9th of September, divers London maids, with a little boy with them,
  visited the ship; the boy fell down into the hold, and died the same
  night from the effects of his fall, being the first accident during the
  building. About the middle of the month, the ship being ready to be
  placed on the ways, twelve choice master carpenters of his Majesty's navy
  were sent for from Chatham to assist in "her striking and launching;" on
  the 18th she was safely set upon her ways, and on the 26th was visited by
  the French ambassador. Preparations were made in the yard for the
  reception of the king, queen, royal children, ladies, and the council;
  and on the evening of the 23rd, a messenger was sent from Theobalds,
  desiring the ship to be searched, lest any disaffected persons might have
  bored holes privily in her bottom. On Monday 24th, the dock gates were
  opened; but the wind blowing hard from the south-west, it proved a very
  bad tide. The king came from Theobalds, though he had been very little at
  ease with a scouring, taken with surfeiting by eating grapes, the prince
  and most of the lords of the council attending him. The queen arrived
  after dinner, and the lord admiral gave commandment to heave taught the
  crabs and screws, though Pette says he had little hope to launch by
  reason the wind overblew the tide; "yet the ship started and had
  launched, but the dock gates pent her in so straight, that she stuck fast
  between them, by reason the ship was nothing lifted by the tide, as we
  expected she would; and the great lighter, by unadvised counsel, being
  cut off the stern, the ship settled so hard upon the ground, that there
  was no possibility of launching that tide; besides which there was such a
  multitude of people got into the ship, that one could scarce stir by
  another."</p>

  <p>"The king was much grieved at the frustrate of his expectation," and
  returned to Greenwich at five o'clock with the queen and her train; the
  prince staid a good while after conferring with the lord admiral and Mr.
  Pette, and then rode off to Greenwich, with a promise to return shortly
  after midnight. The night was moonlight, but shortly after midnight
  became very stormy, which Mr. Pette says made him "doubt that there were
  <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page465"></a>{465}</span>some indirect working among our enemies to
  dash our launching."</p>

  <p>The prince however arrived at the yard, went on board a little before
  two a. m., when the word being given to get all taught, the ship went
  away without any straining of screws or tackles, till she came clear
  afloat in the middle of the channel. He then describes the christening of
  her by the prince, by the name of the "Prince Royal"; and while warping
  to her mooring, his royal highness went down to the platform of the
  cock-room, where the ship's beer stood for ordinary company, and there
  finding an old can without a lid, drew it full of beer himself, and drank
  it off to the lord admiral, and caused him with the rest of the
  attendants to do the like. The hawsers laid ashore for landfasts had been
  treacherously cut, but without doing any injury to the ship. The prince
  left for Greenwich at nine a. m.</p>

<h3>"NOTES AND QUERIES ON THE ORMULUM, BY DR. MONICKE"<br />
(<i>Programm der Handels-Lehranstalt zu Leipzig</i>, 1853).</h3>

  <p>Under the above title, Dr. Monicke has published what are considered
  by a foreign critic some valuable observations on the admirable Oxford
  edition (by Dr. Meadows White) of <i>The Ormulum</i>, an Anglo-Saxon
  work, now first edited from the original MS. in the Bodleian Library. The
  attention of the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," who are occupied in the study
  of the Anglo-Saxon, with its cognate dialects, and direct descendant,
  will be doubly attracted by a title with which they are so familiar, and
  which is associated with some of the happiest and most peaceful moments
  of their life. The title of the Essay (which I have not yet seen, and
  which appears to be written in English) seems to be entirely the choice
  of the author, and must be somewhat flattering to the Editor of the
  original "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<h3>THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SISTERS.</h3>

  <p>Will the Editor of "N. &amp; Q.," or any of his correspondents, kindly
  inform me of the true circumstances from which the following legend has
  sprung? The locality which was the scene of the tragedy is the little
  village of Ballybunion, situated within a few miles of Kerry Head. The
  scenery around is of the wildest and most striking description. Frowning,
  rugged cliffs, rising abruptly out of the water to the height of over one
  hundred feet, and perforated with numerous caves, into which the ocean
  rushes with fearful fury in winter,&mdash;for it is a stormy coast, and
  rarely does a month pass without beholding some dead, putrified body
  washed ashore; while inland, a barren, uncultivated plain, consisting
  mostly of bog, stretches away to nearly the foot of the Reeks, which,
  looming in the distance, seem to rear their giant masses even to the sky,
  and form, as it were, an impenetrable barrier between the coast and the
  interior. On the brink of one of those precipices we have mentioned,
  there stands the ruins of a castle, seemingly of great antiquity. Nothing
  now remains but the basement storey, and that seems as if it would be
  able to withstand the war of winds and waves for hundreds of years
  longer. According to the legend, this castle was inhabited by a gallant
  chieftain at the period of the incursions of the Danes, and who was the
  father of seven blooming daughters. He was himself a brave warrior,
  animated with the greatest hatred against the Ostmen, who, at that
  period, were laying every part of Erin waste. His sword never rested in
  its sheath, and day and night his light gallies cruised about the coast
  on the watch for any piratical marauder who might turn his prow thither.
  One day a sail was observed on the horizon; it came nearer and nearer,
  and the pirate standard was distinguished waving from its mast-head.
  Immediately surrounded by the Irish ships, it was captured after a
  desperate resistance. Those that remained of the crew were slaughtered
  and thrown into the sea, with the exception of the captain and his six
  brothers, who were reserved for a more painful death. Conveyed to the
  fortress, their wounds were dressed, and they were allowed the free range
  of the castle. Here, gradually a love sprung between them and the seven
  Irish maidens, who yielded to their ardent protestations, and agreed to
  fly with them to Denmark. Everything was arranged for the voyage, and one
  fearfully stormy night in winter was chosen for the attempt. Not a single
  star shone in the sky, the cold blast came sweeping from the ocean, the
  rain fell in torrents, and the water roared and raged with terrific
  violence amid the rocky caverns. Escaping down from the battlement by a
  rope-ladder, they discovered to their horror, that on reaching the ground
  they were surrounded by armed men. Not a word was uttered; but they <!--
  Page 466 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page466"></a>{466}</span>well
  knew into whose hands they had fallen. Conducted again within the
  fortress, they found themselves face to face with their injured father.
  One deadly glance of hatred he cast on the prisoners, and, muttering some
  few words to one of his attendants, he pointed towards his daughters. The
  man, on receiving the command, recoiled a few paces, transfixed with
  horror; and then he advanced nearer, and seemed as if remonstrating with
  him. But the parent's face assumed an absolutely demoniac expression; and
  more peremptorily repeating his order, he stalked out of the room. And
  now commenced a fearful scene. The lovers were torn from each other's
  arms, and the women were brought forth again. The storm had grown more
  violent, and the spray was dashing far over the cliff, whilst the vivid
  flashes of lightning afforded a horrible illumination to the dreary
  scene. Proceeding along the brink of the precipice, they at length came
  to a chasm which resembled somewhat the crater of a volcano, as it was
  completely closed, with the exception of the opening at the top, and one
  small aperture below, through which the sea rushed with terrible
  violence. The rolling of the waters sounded fearfully on the ear of those
  around, and now at length the sisters divined their fate. One by one they
  were hurled into the boiling flood: one wild shriek, the billows closed
  again, and all was over. What the fate of their lovers was, the legend
  says not. The old castle has crumbled into ruins&mdash;the chieftain
  sleeps in an unknown grave, his very name forgotten; but still the sad
  ending of the maidens is remembered, and even unto this day the cavern is
  denominated the "Cave of the Seven Sisters." Such is the above legend as
  it still exists amongst the peasantry, and any of your contributors would
  extremely oblige by informing me of the name of the Irish leader.</p>

  <p>"<i>To jump for joy.</i>"&mdash;This expression, now most often used

  description of an actual fact. The <i>Anglo-Norman Poem on the Conquest
  of Ireland by Henry II.</i>, descriptive of events which occurred at the
  close of the twelfth century, informs us (at p.&nbsp;53.) that one of the
  English knights, named Maurice de Prendergast, being desirous of
  returning with his followers to Wales, was impeded in his march by "les

  <p>"<i>What is Truth?</i>"&mdash;Bacon begins his "Essay of Truth" (which
  is dated 1625) with these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.
  Certainly, there be that delight in giddiness, and count it a bondage to
  fix a belief; affecting freewill in thinking, as well as in acting."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a similar passage in Bishop Andrews's sermon <i>Of the
  Resurrection</i>, preached in 1613:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pilate asked, <i>Quid est veritas?</i> And then some other matter
  took him in the head, and so up he rose, and went his way, before he had
  his answer; he deserved never to find what truth was. And such is our
  seeking mostwhat, seldom or never seriously, but some question that comes
  cross our brain for the present, some <i>quid est veritas</i>? So sought
  as if that we sought were as good lost as found. Yet this we would fain
  have so for seeking, but it will not be."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps Bacon heard the bishop preach (the sermon was at Whitehall);
  and if so, the passage in Andrews will explain the word "jesting" to
  mean, not scoffing, but asking without serious purpose of acquiring
  information.</p>

  <p><i>Abolition of Government Patronage.</i>&mdash;The following passage,

  Keeper Hervey, is <!-- Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page467"></a>{467}</span>interesting as showing the enlightened
  sentiments of an eminent scholar a hundred years ago when addressing a
  minister of the crown:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Human nature has ever been the same in all ages and nations, and owes
  the difference of its improvements to a difference only of culture, and
  of the rewards proposed to its industry; where these are the most amply
  provided, there we shall always find the most numerous and shining
  examples of human perfection. In old Rome, the public honours were laid
  open to the virtue of every citizen; which, by raising them in their
  turns to the commands of that mighty empire, produced a race of nobles
  superior even to kings. This was a prospect that filled the soul of the
  ambitious and roused every facility of mind and body to exert its utmost
  force; whereas, in modern states, men's views being usually confined to
  narrow bounds, beyond which they cannot pass, and a partial culture of
  their talents being sufficient to procure everything that their ambition
  can aspire to, a great genius has seldom either room or invitation to
  stretch itself to its full size."</p>

  the mystic prejudices of the age. Amongst the remedies for fixing

  to be fixed by <i>Philidonia</i>, <i>Veratrum nigrum</i>, and a variety

  prove that more attention was paid to the physiological

  <p><i>Custom at University College, Oxford.</i>&mdash;What is the origin
  of the following custom observed at this college? On every Easter Sunday
  the representation of a tree, dressed with evergreens and flowers, is
  placed on a turf, close to the buttery, and every member there resident,
  as he leaves the Hall, after dinner, chops at the tree with a cleaver.
  The college-cook stands by holding a plate, in which the Master deposits
  half a guinea, each Fellow five shillings, and the other members two
  shillings and sixpence each; this custom is called "chopping at the
  tree." When was this custom instituted, and to what circumstance are we
  to attribute its origin? Who presented to the chapel of this College the
  splendid eagle, as a lectern, which forms one of its chief ornaments? Was
  it presented by Dr. Radcliffe, or does it date its origin from the happy
  reign of Queen Mary?</p>

  <p>"<i>Old Dominion.</i>"&mdash;It is stated in a newspaper that the term
  "Old Dominion," generally applied here to the state of Virginia,
  originated from the following facts. During the Protectorate of Cromwell
  the colony of Virginia refused to acknowledge his authority, and sent to
  Flanders for Charles II. to reign over them. Charles accepted, and was
  about to embark, when he was recalled to the throne of England. Upon his
  accession, as a reward for her loyalty, he allowed the colony to quarter
  the arms of England, Ireland, and Scotland, as an independent member of
  the "Old Dominion;" whence the term. What truth is there in this
  story?</p>

  <p><i>Dame Hester Temple.</i>&mdash;"Lady Temple lived to see seven
  hundred of her own descendants: she had thirteen children." I have
  extracted this "sea-serpent" from an extract in Burke from <i>Fuller's
  Worthies</i>, but I am unable to refer to the original for confirmation
  of this astounding fact; if true it is wonderful.</p>

  <p class="author">Y. S. M.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Fuller's amusing account of Dame Hester Temple will be found in his
  <i>Worthies of Buckinghamshire</i>, vol. i. p. 210. edit. 1840. He says:
  "Dame Hester Temple, daughter to Miles Sands, Esq., was born at Latmos in
  this county, and was married to Sir Thomas Temple, of Stow, Baronet. She
  had four sons and nine daughters, which lived to be married, and so
  exceedingly multiplied, that this lady saw seven hundred extracted from
  her body. Reader, I speak within compass, and have left myself a reserve,
  having bought the truth hereof by a wager I lost. Besides, there was a
  new generation of marriageable females just at her death; so that this
  aged vine may be said to wither, even when it had many young boughs ready
  to knit.</p>

  <p>"Had I been one of her relations, and as well enabled as most of them
  be, I would have erected a monument for her&mdash;thus designed. A fair
  tree should have been erected, the said lady and her husband lying at the
  bottom or root thereof; the heir of the family should have ascended both
  the middle and top bough thereof. On the right hand hereof her younger
  sons, <!-- Page 469 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page469"></a>{469}</span>on the left her daughters, should, as so
  many boughs, be spread forth. Her grandchildren should have their names
  inscribed on the branches of those boughs; the great-grandchildren on the
  twigs of those branches; and the great-great-grandchildren on the leaves
  of those twigs. Such as survived her death should be done in a lively
  green, the rest (as blasted) in a pale and yellow fading colour.</p>

  <p>"Pliny, lib. vii. cap. 13. (who reports it as a wonder worthy the
  chronicle, that Chrispinus Hilarus, <i>prælatâ pompâ</i>, 'with open
  ostentation,' sacrificed in the capitol seventy-four of his children and
  children's children attending on him,) would more admire, if admitted to
  this spectacle.</p>

  <p>"Vives telleth us of village in Spain, of about an hundred houses,

<h3>BLANCO WHITE'S SONNET.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 404. 486.)</p>

  <p>This sonnet first appeared in <i>The Bijou</i>, an annual published by
  Pickering in 1828. It is entitled:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6"><span class="scac">"NIGHT AND DEATH.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>A Sonnet: dedicated to S. T. Coleridge, Esq.</i></p>
      <p><i>by his sincere friend Joseph Blanco White.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1">Mysterious night, when the first man but knew</p>
      <p>Thee by report, unseen, and heard thy name,</p>
      <p>Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,</p>
      <p>This glorious canopy of light and blue?</p>
      <p class="i1">Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,</p>
      <p>Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,</p>
      <p>Hesperus, with the host of heaven came,</p>

      <p>Within thy beams, O Sun? Or who could find,</p>
      <p class="i1">Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood reveal'd,</p>
      <p>That to such endless orbs thou mad'st us blind?</p>
      <p>Weak man! Why to shun death this anxious strife?</p>
      <p>If <i>light</i> can thus deceive, wherefore not <i>life</i>?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a letter from Coleridge to White, dated Nov. 28, 1827, he thus
  speaks of it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have now before me two fragments of letters <i>begun</i>, the one
  in acknowledgment of the finest and most graceful sonnet in our language
  (at least it is only in Milton's and Wordsworth's sonnets that I <!--

  John Hookham Frere), the second on the receipt of your 'Letter to Charles
  Butler,'" &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a subsequent letter, without date, Coleridge thus again reverts to
  the circumstance of its having been published without his or White's
  sanction:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But first of your sonnet. On reading the sentences in your letter
  respecting it, I stood staring vacantly on the paper, in a state of
  feeling not unlike that which I have too often experienced in a dream:
  when I have found myself in chains, or in rags, shunned, or passed by,
  with looks of horror blended with sadness, by friends and acquaintance;
  and convinced that, in some alienation of mind, I must have perpetrated
  some crime, which I strove in vain to recollect. I then ran down to Mrs.
  Gillman, to learn whether she or Mr. Gillman could throw any light on the
  subject. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Gillman could account for it. I have
  repeated the sonnet often, but, to the best of my recollection, never
  either gave a copy to any one, or permitted any one to transcribe it; and
  as to publishing it without your consent, you must allow me to say the
  truth: I had felt myself so much flattered by your having addressed it to
  me, that I should have been half afraid that it would appear to be asking
  to have my vanity tickled, if I had thought of applying to you for
  permission to publish it. Where and when did it appear? If you will be so
  good as to inform me, I may perhaps trace it out: for it annoys me to
  imagine myself capable of such a breach of confidence and of
  delicacy."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In his Journal, October 16 [1838?], Blanco White says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<h3>GOLOSHES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 304.)</p>

  <p>This word, <span class="sc">Seleucus</span> says, "is of course of
  American derivation." By no means: it is found in German,
  <i>gallosche</i> or <i>gallusche</i>; and in French, <i>galoche</i> or
  <i>galloche</i>. The word itself most likely comes to us from the French.
  The dictionaries refer to Spenser as using it under the form
  <i>galage</i>; and it occurs written <i>galege</i>, <i>galosh</i>,
  <i>calosh</i>, &amp;c. The French borrowed the term from the Latin
  <i>Gallicæ</i>; but the Romans first derived the idea and the thing
  itself from Gaul, <i>Gallicæ</i> denoting Gallic or Gaulish shoes. Cicero
  speaks of the <i>Gallicæ</i> with contempt.&mdash;"Cum calceis et toga,
  nullis nec <i>gallicis</i> nec lacerna;" and again, "Cum <i>gallicis</i>
  et lacerna cucurristi" (<i>Philip.</i> ii. 30.). Blount, in his <i>Law
  Dictionary</i> (1670), gives the following, which refers to one very
  early use of the term in this country:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Galege</span> (<i>galiciæ</i>), from the French
  <i>galloches</i>, which signified of old a certain shoe worn by the Gauls
  in foul weather, <i>as at present the signification with us does not much
  differ</i>. It is mentioned 4 Edw. IV. cap. 7., and 14 &amp; 15 Hen.
  VIII. cap. 9."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Therefore the thing itself and the word were known among us before
  America was discovered. As it regards the Latin word <i>Gallicæ</i>, I
  only know of its use by Cicero, Tertullian, and A. Gellius. The
  last-named, in the <i>Noctes Atticæ</i>, gives the following anecdote and
  observations relating to this word. T. Castricius, a teacher of rhetoric
  at Rome, observing that some of his pupils were, on a holiday, as he
  deemed, unsuitably attired, and shod (<i>soleati</i>) with <i>gallicæ</i>
  (<i>galloches</i>, <i>sabots</i>, wooden shoes or clogs), he expressed in
  strong terms his disapprobation. He stated it to be unworthy of their
  rank, and referred to the above-cited passage from Cicero. Some of his
  hearers inquired why he called those <i>soleati</i> who wore goloshes
  (<i>gallicæ</i>) and not shoes (<i>soleæ</i>). The expression is
  justified by a statement which sufficiently describes the goloshes, viz.,
  that they call <i>soleæ</i> (shoes) all those which cover only the lower
  portions of the foot, and are fastened with straps. The author adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I think that <i>gallicæ</i> is a new word, which was begun to be used
  not long before Cicero's time, therefore used by him in the Second of the
  <i>Antonians</i>. 'Cum gallicis,' says he, 'et lacerna cucurristi.' Nor
  do I read it in any other writer of authority, but other words are
  employed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Romans named shoes after persons and places as we do: for
  examples, see Dr. W. Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman
  Antiquities</i>, sub voc. "Calceus."</p>

  <p class="author">B. H. C.</p>

  <p class="address">Poplar.</p>

  <p>This word is not of American derivation. In the <i>Promptorium
  Parvulorum</i> we find,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Galache</span> or <span class="sc">Galoche</span>,
  undersolynge of manny's fote."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Way says in his note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The galache was a sort of patten, fastened to the foot by cross
  latchets, and worn by men as early as the <!-- Page 471 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page471"></a>{471}</span>time of Edward III.
  Allusion is made to it by Chaucer,</p>

      <p class="hg1">'Ne were worthy to unbocle his galoche.'&mdash;<i>Squires Tale</i>, 10,869."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among many other quotations Mr. Way gives the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To geten hym gilte spores,</p>
      <p class="i1">Or galoches y-couped."&mdash;<i>Piers Ploughman</i>, 12,099.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in the <i>Wardrobe Book of Prince Henry</i>, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1607, are mentioned&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1 pair of golossians, 6<i>s.</i>; 16 gold buckles with pendants and
  toungs to buckle a pair of golosses."&mdash;<i>Archæol.</i> xi. 93.</p>

  <p>Nares says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Galage.</span> A clown's coarse shoe from
  <i>galloche</i>, a shoe with a wooden sole, old French, which itself is
  supposed to be from <i>gallica</i>, a kind of shoe mentioned by Cicero,
  <i>Philip.</i> ii. 30., and A. Gellius, xiii. 21. If so, the word has
  returned to the country whence it was first taken, but I doubt much of
  that derivation; by the passages referred to in the above authors, it
  seems more likely that the <i>gallica</i> was a luxurious covering, than
  one so very coarse as the galloche. Perhaps the <i>caliga</i>, or
  military strong boot of the Romans, from which Caligula was named, may be
  a better origin for it. The word <i>galloche</i> is now naturalised among
  us for a kind of clog, worn over the shoes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>See also Richardson's <i>Dictionary</i>, s. v. "Galoche."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Zeus.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Seleucus</span> need not have gone quite so far as to
  "the tribe of North American Indians, the Goloshes," or to America at
  all, for his derivation. If he will look in his French dictionary he will
  find,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Galoche</i> (espèce de mule que l'on porte par dessus les

  <p>I quote from Boyer's <i>Dictionnaire Royal</i>, edit. 1753.</p>

  <p>From this analysis it appears that the excess of consonant
  <i>letters</i> over vowels is, in English, 299; and in Welsh, 159, a
  little more than one-half. The excess of consonant <i>sounds</i> is, in
  English, 246; in Welsh, 51, considerably less than one-fourth.</p>

  <p>This result might readily have been anticipated by anybody familiar
  with the following facts:</p>

  <p>1. On examining lists of the elementary sounds of both languages, it
  will be found that the Welsh has a greater number of vowels than the
  English, and the English a greater number of consonants than the
  Welsh.</p>

  <p>2. Welsh diphthongs are much more numerous than English.</p>

  <p>3. In English, <i>three</i> vowels only constitute words in themselves
  (<i>a</i>, article; <i>I</i>, pronoun; <i>O</i>, interjection), and each
  is used only in one sense. In Welsh, <i>five</i> of the vowels (<i>a</i>,
  <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>y</i>) are words; and they are used in
  at least a dozen different significations. <i>A</i>, besides being an
  affirmative and interrogative adverb, answers to the English <i>and</i>,
  <i>as</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>will go</i>.</p>

  <p>4. Diphthongs forming distinct words are much more numerous in Welsh
  than in English. The following occur: <i>ai</i>, <i>a'i</i> (=<i>a
  ei</i>), <i>a'u</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>eu</i>, <i>ia</i>, <i>ïe</i>,
  <i>i'w</i>, <i>o'i</i>, <i>o'u</i>, <i>ow</i>, <i>&#x175;y</i>,
  <i>yw</i>.</p>

  <p>5. In Welsh there are no such clusters of consonants as occur in the
  English words <i>arched</i> <!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page472"></a>{472}</span>(pronounced <i>artsht</i>),
  <i>parched</i>, <i>scorched</i>, <i>marched</i>, <i>hinged</i>
  (<i>hindzhd</i>), <i>singed</i>, <i>cringed</i>, <i>fringed</i>,
  <i>purged</i> (<i>purdzhd</i>), <i>charged</i> (<i>tshardzhd</i>),
  <i>scratched</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. From the difficulty encountered in
  pronouncing some of these combinations, arise the vulgar errors heard in
  some parts of the country: <i>burstis</i> for <i>bursts</i>,
  <i>castis</i> for <i>casts</i>. Three consonants are very rarely thus
  crushed together in Welsh,&mdash;four, never.</p>

  <p>6. The Welsh, to avoid an unpleasant hiatus, often introduce a
  consonant. Hence we have <i>y</i> or <i>yr</i>, the; <i>a</i> or
  <i>ac</i>, and; <i>a</i> or <i>ag</i>, as; <i>na</i> or <i>nac</i>, not;
  <i>na</i> or <i>nag</i>, than; <i>sy</i> or <i>sydd</i>, is; <i>o</i>,
  from, becomes <i>odd</i>; <i>i</i>, to, becomes <i>idd</i>. I cannot call
  to mind more than one similar example in English, <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>;
  and its existence is attributable to the superfluity of consonants,
  <i>n</i> being <i>dropped</i> in <i>a</i>, not <i>added</i> in
  <i>an</i>.</p>

  <p>The mystery of the consonants in the swearing Welshman's mouth
  (humorously described by Messrs. Chambers) is difficult of explanation.
  The words usual in Welsh oaths afford no clue to its solution; for the
  name of the Deity has two consonants and one vowel in English, while it
  has two vowels and one consonant in Welsh. Another name invoked on these
  occasions has three consonants and two vowels in English, and one of the
  vowels is usually elided; in Welsh it has three vowels and three
  consonants, and colloquially the middle consonant is dropped. The Welsh
  borrow a few imprecatory words from the English, and in appropriating
  them they <i>append the vowel termination</i> o <i>or</i> io. Prejudice
  or imagination, therefore, seems to have had something to do in
  describing poor Taffy's profanities.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I may add that the Hundredth Psalm was chosen for
  analysis without a previous knowledge that it would present a greater
  excess of consonants (letters or sounds) in English than in Welsh. I do
  not believe two chapters from the Bible can be produced, which will show
  an opposite result.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Gwilym Glan Tywi.</span></p>

  <p>There is no <i>k</i> in the Welsh alphabet, a circumstance which
  reduces the consonants to twenty; while a farther reduction is made by
  the fact that <i>w</i> and <i>y</i> are <i>always</i> vowels in Welsh,
  instead of being only occasionally so, as in English. J.&nbsp;M. will
  therefore find that the Welsh alphabet contains but eighteen consonants
  and seven vowels, twenty-five letters in all.</p>

  <p>This, however, I imagine, is not the point on which he wishes for
  information. If a stranger glances at a page of Welsh without being aware
  that <i>y</i> and <i>w</i> are, strictly speaking, vowels, he will of
  course naturally conclude that he sees an over proportion of consonants.
  Hence, probably, has arisen the very general idea on the subject, which
  is perhaps strengthened by the frequent occurrence of the double
  consonants <i>Ll</i> and <i>Dd</i>, the first of which is but a sign,
  standing for a peculiar softening of the letter; and the latter for
  <i>Th</i> of the English language.</p>

  <p>Such an idea might perhaps be conveyed by the following instances,
  taken at random: <i>Dywyll</i>, <i>Dydd</i>, <i>Gwyddna</i>,
  <i>Llwyn</i>, <i>Gwyrliw</i>, &amp;c. But it will be dispelled by an
  orthography adapted to the pronunciation; thus <i>Dou-ill</i><a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, <i>Deeth</i>,
  <i>Goo-eeth-na</i>, <i>Lloo-een</i>, <i>Gueer-leeoo</i>.</p>

  <p>J. M. will be interested to know that the Welsh language can furnish
  almost unexampled instances of an accumulation of vowels, such as that
  furnished by the word <i>ieuainc</i>, young men, &amp;c.; but above all
  by the often-quoted <i>englyn</i> or stanza on the spider or silkworm,
  which, in its four lines, <i>does not contain a single consonant</i>:</p>

  <p>In reply to J. M. I beg to ask who ever before heard that consonants
  "cracked and cracked, and ground and exploded?" and how could the writer
  in Chambers's <i>Repository</i> possibly know that the drunken Welshman
  cursed and swore in <i>consonants</i>? There is scarcely a more
  harshly-sounding word in the Welsh language&mdash;admitted by a clever
  and satirical author to have "the softness and harmony of the Italian,
  with the majesty and expression of the Greek"&mdash;than the term
  <i>crack</i>, adopted from the Dutch. There is no Welsh monosyllable that
  contains, like the Saxon <i>strength</i>, seven consonants with only one
  vowel. There is no Welsh proper name, like Rentzsch, the watchmaker of
  Regent Street, that contains six consonants in succession in one
  syllable; and yet the Welsh have never accused their <i>younger</i>
  sister with the use of consonants which "cracked and cracked, and ground
  and exploded." But if the Welsh language, with "its variety, copiousness,
  and even harmony, to be equalled by few, perhaps excelled by none," has
  no instance of six consonants in succession, it has one of six vowels in
  succession, <i>Gwaewawr</i>, every one of which requires, according to
  the peculiarity of its pronunciation, a separate inflection of the
  voice.</p>

  <p>J. M. may be assured that the remark of the writer in question is only
  one of those pitiful "cracks" which flippant authors utter in plain
  ignorance of Cymru, Cymraeg, and Cymry.</p>

<h3>SONGS of DEGREES (ASCENTS).</h3>

  <p>The analysis of the word <span lang="he" class="heb"

  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B2;&#x5DC;&#x5B8;&#x5D4;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  the <i>chamber-over</i>. (Neh. ix. 4., xii. 37.; Jos. x. 10.; 1 Sam. ix.
  11.; Am. ix. 6.; Ps. civ. 13.) The translators of the authorised version,
  in using the word "degrees," intended probably to convey the notion of
  <i>rank</i>; but the modern mixed-mathematical ideas lead us of this day
  rather to think of geographical, barometrical, &amp;c. degrees. That
  <i>steps</i> is the word most accordant with the ancient notions is
  evident from the concurrence of the Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and
  Ethiopic versions, as also from the Chaldee Targum, alluded to by
  J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;G., which has the inscription <span lang="he" class="heb"

  "a song called 'over the <i>steps</i> of the deep'" (Deut. viii. 7.; Ex.
  xv. 8.). The root of this moral is <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="`LCH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5D7;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  in the Hebrew and its cognates, and the primitive notion is <i>to
  ascend</i>; from which is formed in Arabic <a
  href="images/238_473a.png"><img src="images/238_473a.png" class="middle"

  Chaldee <span lang="he" class="heb" title="`ALIYT" ><bdo

  <p>The <span lang="he" class="heb" title="M" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;</bdo></span>&#x200E; prefixed is the
  <i>participial</i> form of the verb, equivalent to the termination
  <i>ing</i> in English; and converts the verb also into a verbal noun,
  conveying the generalised idea of a class of <i>actions</i>; and thereby
  the steps, <span lang="he" class="heb" title="HM`LWT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D4;&#x5DE;&#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  <i>the steppings upward</i>, literally, which means "the ascents," or
  "the ascendings."</p>

  <p>The ascent by fifteen steps of the rabbins is probably equally
  apocryphal with the quotations from St. Matthew and St. James (ix.
  p.&nbsp;376.); for the same reason (Ex. xx. 26.) which forbad the ascending
  the altar by steps, would apply still more strongly to the supposed
  "fifteen steps leading from the Atrium Israelis to the court of the
  <i>women</i>."<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

  <i>not</i> used in the Jewish liturgy. I will only refer you to
  Lightfoot's ninth volume (Pitman's edition), where the Psalms used, and
  indeed the whole service of the Jews, is as clearly set forth as the
  Greek service is in the liturgies of Basil and Chrysostom.</p>

<h3>THE SCREW PROPELLER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 394.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Anon.</span> is clearly mistaken in thinking that,
  when Darwin says that "the <i>undulating</i> motion of the tail of fishes
  might be applied behind a boat with greater effect than common oars," he
  had any idea of a screw propeller. He meant not a <i>rotatory</i>, but,
  as he says, an "undulating" motion, like that of the fish's tail: such as
  we see every day employed by the boys in all our rivers and harbours,
  called <i>sculling</i>&mdash;that is, driving a boat forward by the rapid
  lateral right and left impulsion of a single oar, worked from the stern
  of the boat. It was the application of steam to some such machinery as
  this that Darwin seems to have meant; and not to the special action of a
  <i>revolving cut-water screw</i>.</p>

  <p>I avail myself of this occasion to record, that about the date of
  Darwin's publication, or very soon after, the very ingenious Earl
  Stanhope not only thought of, but actually employed, the identical screw
  propeller now in use in a vessel which he had fitted up for the purpose;
  and in which, by his invitation, I, and several other gentlemen,
  accompanied him in various trips backwards and forwards between
  Blackfriars and Westminster bridges. The instrument was a long iron axle,
  <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474"></a>{474}</span>working on the stern port of the vessel,
  having at the end in the water a wheel of inclined planes, exactly like
  the flyer of a smoke-jack; while, inboard, the axle was turned by a crank
  worked by the men. The velocity attained was, I think, said to be four
  miles an hour. I am sorry that I am not able to specify the exact date of
  this experiment, but it must have been between 1802 and 1805. What Lord
  Stanhope said about employing steam to work his machine, I do not clearly
  recollect. He entered into a great many details about it, but I remember
  nothing distinctly but the machine itself.</p>

<h3>AMONTILLADO SHERRY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 222. 336.)</p>

  <p>The wines of Xérès consist of two kinds, viz. sweet and dry, each of
  which is again subdivided into two other varieties. Amontillado sherry,
  or simply Amontillado, belongs to the latter class, the other description
  produced from the dry wine being sherry, properly so called, that which
  passes in this country generally by that name. These two wines, although
  differing from each other in the peculiarities of colour, smell, and
  flavour, are produced from the same grape, and in precisely a similar
  manner; indeed, it frequently happens that of two or more <i>botas</i>,
  or large casks, filled with the same <i>moùt</i> (wort or sweet wine),
  and subjected to the same manipulation, the one becomes Amontillado, and
  the other natural sherry. This mysterious transformation takes place
  ordinarily during the first, but sometimes even during the second year,
  and in a manner that has hitherto baffled the attempts of the most
  attentive observer to discover. Natural sherry has a peculiar aromatic
  flavour, somewhat richer than that of its brother, the Amontillado, and
  partakes of three different colours, viz. pale or straw, golden, and deep
  golden, the latter being the description denominated by us brown sherry.
  The Amontillado is of a straw colour only, more or less shaded according
  to the age it possesses. Its flavour is drier and more delicate than that
  of natural sherry, recalling in a slight degree the taste of nuts and
  almonds. This wine, beings produced by a phenomenon which takes place it
  is imagined during the fermentation, is naturally less abundant than the
  other description of sherry, and there are years in which it is produced
  in very small quantities, and sometimes even not at all; for the same
  reason it is age for age dearer also. The word "Amontillado" signifies
  like or similar to Montilla, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the wine manufactured at that
  place. Montilla is situated in Upper Andalusia, in the neighbourhood of
  Cordouc, and produces an excellent description of wine, but which, from
  the want of roads and communication with the principal commercial towns
  of Spain, is almost entirely unknown.</p>

  <p>The two sweet wines of Xérès are the "Paxarite," or "Pedro Ximenès,"
  and the "Muscatel." The first-named is made from a species of grape
  called "Pedro Ximenès," sweeter in quality than that which produces the
  dry sherry, and which, moreover, is exposed much longer to the action of
  the sun previous to the process of manufacture; its condition when
  subjected to the action of the pressers resembling very nearly that of a
  raisin. Fermentation is in this case much more rapid on account of the
  saccharine nature of the <i>moùt</i> or wort. In flavour it is similar to
  the fruit called "Pedro Ximenès," the colour being the same as that of
  natural sherry. Muscate wine is made from the grape of that name, and in
  a manner precisely similar to the Paxarite. The wine produced from this
  grape is still sweeter than the Pedro Ximenès, its taste being absolutely
  that of the Muscat grape. In colour also it is deeper; but the colour of
  both, like that of the two dry wines, increases in proportion to their
  age, a circumstance exactly the reverse of that which takes place in
  French wines. German sherry wines are capable of preservation both in
  bottles and casks for an indefinite period. In one of the <i>bodegas</i>
  or cellars belonging to the firm of M.&nbsp;P. Domecq, at Xérès, are to be
  seen five or six casks of immense size and antiquity (some of them, it is
  said, exceeding a century). Each of them bears the name of some
  distinguished hero of the age in which it was produced, Wellington and
  Napoleon figuring conspicuously amongst others: the former is preserved
  exclusively for the taste of Englishmen.</p>

  <p>The history of sherry dates, in a commercial point of view, from about
  the year 1720 only. Before this period it is uncertain whether it
  possessed any existence at all; at all events it appears to have been
  unknown beyond the immediate neighbourhood in which it was produced. It
  would be difficult, perhaps, to say by whom it was first imported: all
  that can be affirmed with any degree of certainty is, that a Frenchman,
  by name Pierre Domecq, the founder of the house before mentioned, was
  among the earliest to recognise its capabilities, and to bring it to the
  high state of perfection which it has since attained. In appreciation of
  the good service thus rendered to his country, Ferdinand VII. conferred
  upon this house the right exclusively to bear upon their casks the royal
  arms of Spain. This wine, from being at first cultivated only in small
  quantities, has long since grown into one of the staple productions of
  the country. In the neighbourhood of Xérès there are at present under
  cultivation from 10,000 to 12,000 <i>arpents</i> of vines; these produce
  annually from 30,000 to 35,000 <i>botas</i>, equal to 70,000 or 75,000
  hogsheads. In gathering the <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page475"></a>{475}</span>fruit, the ripest is invariably selected
  for wines of the best quality. The wines of Xérès, like all those of the
  peninsula, require the necessary body or strength to enable them to
  sustain the fatigue of exportation. Previous, therefore, to shipment
  (none being sold under four to five years of age), a little <i>eau de
  vie</i> (between the fiftieth and sixtieth part) is added, a quantity in
  itself so small, that few would imagine it to be the cause of the slight
  alcoholic taste which nearly all sherries possess.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the high price of the delicious wines, numerous
  imitations, or inferior sherries, are manufactured, and sold in immense
  quantities. Of these the best are to be met with at the following places:
  San Lucar, Porto, Santa Maria, and even Malaga itself. The spurious
  sherry of the first-named place is consumed in larger quantities,
  especially in France, than the genuine wine itself. One reason for this
  may be, that few vessels go to take cargoes at Cadiz; whilst many are in
  the habit of doing so to Malaga for dry fruits, and to Seville for the
  fine wool of Estremadura. San Lucar is situated at the mouth of the
  Guadalquiver.</p>

<h3>RECENT CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 136.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Thackeray's work, <i>The Newcomes</i>, would, if consulted by your
  correspondent, furnish him with farther examples. For instance, Colonel
  Newcome's Christian name is stated (pp. 27. 57.) to be Thomas: at p.&nbsp;49.
  he is designated Col. J. Newcome. The letter addressed to him (p. 27.) is
  superscribed "Major Newcome," although at p. 25. he is styled "Colonel."
  At p.&nbsp;71. mention is made of "Mr. Shaloo, the great Irish patriot," who
  at p.&nbsp;74. becomes "Mr. Shaloony," and at p. 180. relapses into the
  dissyllabic "Shaloo." Clive Newcome is represented (p. 184.) as admiring
  his youthful mustachios, and Mr. Doyle has depicted him without whiskers:
  at p.&nbsp;188. Ethel, "after Mr. Clive's famous mustachios made their
  appearance, rallied him," and "asked him if he was (were?) going into the
  army? She could not understand how any but military men could wear
  mustachios." On this the author remarks, three lines farther on: "If
  Clive had been in love with her, no doubt he would have sacrificed even
  those beloved <i>whiskers</i> for the charmer."</p>

  <p>At p. 111. the Rev. C. Honeyman is designated "A.M.," although
  previously described a Master of Arts of Oxford, where the Masters are
  styled "M.A." in contradistinction to the Masters of Arts in every other
  university. Cambridge Masters frequently affix M.A. to their names, but I
  never heard of an instance of an Oxonian signing the initials of his
  degree as A.M.</p>

  <p>Apropos of Oxford, I recently met the following sentence at p.&nbsp;3. of
  <i>Verdant Green</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Although pronounced by Mrs. Toosypegs, his nurse, to be 'a perfect
  progidye,' yet we are not aware that his <i>début</i> on the stage of
  life, although thus applauded by such a <i>clacqueur</i> as the
  indiscriminating Toosypegs, was announced to the world at large by any
  other means than the notices in the county papers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the author ever watched the hired applauders in a Parisian theatre,
  he would have discerned among them <i>clacqueuses</i> as well as
  <i>clacqueurs</i>.</p>

<h3>ROLAND THE BRAVE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 372.)</p>

  <p>In justification of Dr. Forbes' identifying Roland the Brave with the
  hero of Schiller's ballad, Ritter Toggenburg, I beg to refer your
  correspondent X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. to <i>Deutsches Sagenbuch, von L. Bechstein</i>,
  Leipzig, 1853, where (p. 95.) the same tale is related which forms the
  subject of Mrs. Hemans' beautiful ballad, only with this difference, that
  there the account of Roland's death entirely agrees with Schiller's
  version of the story, whereas the English poet has adopted the general
  tradition of Roland's fall at Roncesvalles.</p>

  <p>Most of the epic poems of the middle ages in which Roland's death is
  recorded, especially the different old French <i>Chansons de Roland ou de
  Roncevaux</i>, an Icelandic poem on the subject, and Stricker's
  middle-high German lay of Roland, all of them written between A.D. 1100
  and 1230&mdash;agree in this, that after Roland's fall at Roncesvalles,
  and the complete rout of the heathen by Charlemagne, the latter returns
  home and is met&mdash;some say at Aix-la-Chapelle, others at Blavie,
  others at Paris&mdash;by Alda or Alite, Olivier's sister, who inquires of
  him where Roland, her betrothed, is. On learning his fate she dies on the
  spot of grief. According to monk Conrad (about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1175), Alda was Roland's wife. See <i>Ruolandes
  Liet, von W. Grimm</i>, Göttingen, 1838, pp. 295&mdash;297.</p>

  <p>The legend of Rolandseck, as told by Bechstein from Rhenish folk lore,
  begins thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Es sasz auf hoher Burg am Rhein hoch über dem Stromthal ein junger
  Rittersmann, Roland geheiszen, (manche sagen Roland von Angers, Neffe
  Karls des Groszen), der liebte ein Burgfräulein, Hildegunde, die Tochter
  des Burggrafen Heribert, der auf dem nahen Schlosz Drachenfels sasz,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here the question is left open whether the hero of the story was
  Roland the Brave, or some other knight of that name. The latter seems the
  more probable, as Roland's fall at Roncesvalles is one of the chief
  subjects of mediæval poetry, whereas the death of knight Roland in sight
  of <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page476"></a>{476}</span>Nonnenwerth on the Rhine, forms the very
  pith of the German local legend. From certain coincidences, however, it
  was easy to blend the two stories together into one, as was done by Mrs.
  Hemans. As to Schiller, we may suppose that he either followed altogether
  a different legend, or, perhaps to avoid misconception, substituted
  another name for that of knight Roland, similar to what he has done in
  other instances.</p>

  <p class="author">R. R.</p>

  <p class="address">Canterbury.</p>

  <p>I think your correspondent X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. is mistaken in attributing to Mrs.
  Hemans the lines on the "Brave Roland." In Mr. Campbell's <i>Poems</i> he
  will find some stanzas which bear a striking resemblance to those he has
  quoted. I subjoin those stanzas to which X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. has referred:</p>

      <p class="i1">Expired at Roncevall."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>X. Y. Z. seems also to have forgotten what Mr. Campbell duly records,
  viz. that Roland used to station himself at a window overlooking "the
  nun's green isle;" it being after her decease that he met his death at
  Roncevall, which event, by the way, is alluded to by Sir W. Scott in
  <i>Marmion</i>, canto vi.:</p>

  <p>The legends of Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, are very numerous
  and vary much from each other. The Orlando of Pulci has a very different
  history from the Orlando of Bojardo and Ariosto.</p>

  <p>The legend of "Rolandseck and the Nonnenwerth," which has been adopted
  by Campbell, not Mrs. Hemans, and charmingly set to music by Mrs.
  Arkwright, is well known on the Rhine. There are two poems on the legend
  in Simrock's <i>Rheinsagen</i> (12mo., Bonn, 1841), one by the editor,
  and another by August Kopisch. They exactly accord with Campbell's
  poem.</p>

  <p>The legend of Ritter Toggenburg resembles that of Roland in many
  particulars, but it is not the same, and it belongs to another locality,
  to Kloster Fischingen, and not to Nonnenwerth. "Roland the Brave" appears
  in all the later editions of Campbell's <i>Poems</i>. Simrock's
  <i>Rheinsagen</i> is one of the most delightful handbooks that any one
  can take through the romantic region which the poems (partly well
  selected by the editor, and partly as well written by himself)
  describe.</p>

  <p class="author">E. C. H.</p>

  <p>The author of the beautiful lines which are quoted by your
  correspondent X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z., is Campbell, not Mrs. Hemans. The poet, in the
  fifth stanza of his ballad, tells how the unfortunate Roland, on finding
  that Hildegund had taken the veil, was accustomed to sit at his window,
  and "sad and oft" to look "on the mansion of his love below."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Recovery of Silver.</i>&mdash;As many correspondents of "N. &amp;
  Q." have asked how to recover the silver from their nitrate baths when
  deteriorated or spoiled, perhaps the following hints may be acceptable to
  them. Let them first precipitate the silver in the form of a chloride by
  adding common salt to the nitrate solution. Let them then filter it, and
  it may be reduced to its metallic state by either of the three following
  methods.</p>

  <p>1. By adding to the wet chloride at least double its volume of water,
  containing one-tenth part of sulphuric acid; plunge into this a thick
  piece of zinc, and leave it here for four-and-twenty hours. The chloride
  of silver will be reduced by the formation of <!-- Page 477 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page477"></a>{477}</span>chloride and sulphate
  of zinc, and of pure silver, which will remain under the form of a
  blackish powder, which is then to be washed, filtered, and preserved for
  the purpose of making nitrate of silver.</p>

  <p>2. The chloride of silver which is to be reduced is put into a flask
  with about twice its volume of a solution of caustic potash (of one part
  of caustic potash to nine of water), in which a small portion of sugar
  has been dissolved. Let it boil gently. The operation is complete when
  the blackish powder which results from this process, having been washed
  in several waters, is entirely soluble in nitric acid, which is easily
  ascertained by experimenting on a small quantity. This powder is to be
  preserved in the same way as the former for the purpose of converting it
  into nitrate of silver.</p>

  <p>3. The metallic silver is obtained in the form of a button, by mixing
  thoroughly 100 parts of dried chloride of silver, 70 parts of chalk or
  whitening, and 4 parts of charcoal. This mixture is to be exposed in a
  crucible to a fierce red heat for at least half an hour. When completely
  cold the crucible is broken, and a button of pure silver is the result.
  The first two processes are those which I should most strongly recommend
  to your correspondents.</p>

  sold rapidly. If I can procure one, it shall be forwarded to Mr.

  <p>The story is a true one, and related to a daughter of Sir William
  Kendrick's, who succeeded him, and was possessor of Calcot Place in the
  parish of Tylehurst, and to Benjamin Child, Esq., whom she met at a
  marriage feast in the neighbourhood. A wood near Calcot is where the
  party met to fight the duel in case Mr. Child rejected the proposals of
  marriage made to him by Miss Kendrick.</p>

  <p>I had the account from an old man between eighty and ninety years of
  age, clerk of the parish; and my friend Miss Mitford agreed with me in
  the accuracy of the story: she had it from the late Countess Dowager of
  Macclesfield, an old lady celebrated for her extensive and accurate
  knowledge of legendary lore.</p>

  <p><i>Mousehunt</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 516. 606.; Vol. ix., pp. 65. 136.
  385.).&mdash;In Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;65., the <i>Natural History of
  Quadrupeds</i>, by James H. Fennell, is quoted; where, speaking of the
  Beech Marten (<i>alias</i> Mousehunt), he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Selkirkshire it has been observed to descend to <i>the shore</i>
  at night time to feed upon mollusks, particularly upon the large Basket
  Mussel (<i>Mytilus modiolus</i>)."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In p. 136, I ventured to state that Mr. Fennell must have been a
  better naturalist than geographer, as Selkirkshire was well known to be
  an inland county nowhere approaching the sea by many miles. I added, that
  I hoped, for Mr. Fennell's sake, that <i>Selkirkshire</i> was either a
  misprint or a misquotation.</p>

  <p>In p. 385. <span class="sc">Mr. Archibald Fraser</span>, Woodford, not
  choosing to exonerate Mr. Fennell by either of my suggestions, prefers,
  as a staunch, but I think rather an inconsiderate friend and champion, to
  <i>vindicate</i> the paragraph as it stands, by candidly admitting that
  if the word <i>beach</i> had been used, it would certainly have referred
  to the sea; but that the word <i>shore</i> applies to rivers as well as
  seas. And he goes back as far as Spenser to find an instance of its use,
  as applied to the banks of the river Nile.</p>

  <p>I will not agree that this use is nearly obsolete, but give him the
  full value of his quotation from Spenser. But what does he say to the
  <i>habitat</i> of the <i>Mytilus modiolus</i>, which the Mousehunt goes
  <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Whence it may be inferred that 1000<i>l.</i> in 1640, 1660, and 1680
  did not vary much from its value at the present time, <i>such value being
  measured in silver</i>. But as the value of all commodities resolves
  itself ultimately into the cost of labour, the rate of wages at these
  dates, in the particular country or part of a country, must be taken as
  the only safe criterion.</p>

  <p>Thus, if labour were 20<i>d.</i> per diem in 1640, and is 40<i>d.</i>
  at this time, 1000<i>l</i>. in 1640 is equivalent to 500<i>l.</i> (only
  half as much) now. But, on the contrary, as the cost of production of
  numerous articles by machinery, &amp;c. has been <i>by so much</i>
  reduced, the power of purchase now, as compared with 1640, of
  1000<i>l.</i>, is <i>by so much</i> increased. The article itself must
  determine by how much. The question put by C.&nbsp;H. is too general to admit
  of a positive solution; but should he specify the commodity and place of
  investment in the seventeenth century and to-day of the 1000<i>l.</i>,
  our statistics might still be at fault, and deny us even a proximate
  determination of his inquiry. Even his 1000<i>l.</i>, which he may
  consider a fixed measure of value, or <i>punctum comparationis</i>, is
  varying in value (=power of purchase) daily, even hourly, as regards
  almost every exchangeable product. Tooke <i>On Prices</i> is a first-rate
  authority on this subject.</p>

  <p><i>Hand-bells at Funerals</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.; Vol. vii., p.
  297.).&mdash;A few years ago I happened to arrive at the small sea-port
  of Roscoff, near the ancient cathedral town of St. Pol de Léon in
  Britanny, on the day appointed for the funeral of one of the members of a
  family of very old standing in that neighbourhood. My attention was
  attracted by a number of boys running about the streets with small
  hand-bells, with which they kept up a perpetual tinkling. On inquiring of
  a friend of mine, a native of the place, what this meant, he informed me
  that it was an old custom in Britanny&mdash;but one which in the present
  day had almost fallen into disuse&mdash;to send boys round from door to
  door with bells to announce when a death had occurred, and to give notice
  of the day and the hour at which the funeral was to take place, begging
  at the same time the prayers of the faithful for the soul of the
  deceased. The boys selected for this office are taken from the most
  indigent classes, and, on the day of the funeral, receive cloaks of
  coarse black cloth as an alms: thus attired, they attend the funeral
  procession, tinkling their bells as they go along.</p>

  <p>"<i>Warple-way</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 125.).&mdash;The communications of
  your correspondents (Vol. ix., p. 232.) can scarcely be called answers to
  the questions put.</p>

  <p>I find, in Holloway's <i>Dictionary of Provincialisms</i>, 8vo., 1838,
  that a ridge of land is called, in husbandry, a <i>warp</i>. It is
  defined to be a quantity of land consisting of ten, twelve, or more
  ridges; on each side of which a furrow is left, to carry off the
  water.</p>

  <p>Again, in Halliwell's <i>Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial
  Words</i>, two volumes, 1847, it will be <!-- Page 479 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page479"></a>{479}</span>found that <i>warps</i>
  are distinct pieces of ploughed land, separated by furrows. I think I
  here give the derivation and meaning, and refer to the authority. If the
  derivation be not here given, then I would refer to the Saxon word
  <i>werpen</i>, meaning "to cast."</p>

  <p>Across marshy grounds, to this day, are seen ridges forming
  foot-paths, with a furrow on each side. A ridge of this sort would
  formerly be, perhaps, a <i>warple-way</i>. Or perhaps a path across an
  open common field, cast off or divided, as Halliwell mentions, by warps,
  would be a <i>warple-way</i>.</p>

  along the borders of shires and divisions of shires, such as
  <i>hundreds</i>, I would suggest that they were military roads,&mdash;the
  derivation <i>waffe</i> (Ger.), weapon.</p>

  <p><i>Medal of Chevalier St. George</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 105.

  A.&nbsp;S. and H., I would beg to observe that, some time ago, I gave to the
  Museum at Winchester a medal struck on the occasion of the marriage of
  Prince James F.&nbsp;E. Stuart and M. Clementina Sobieski: on the obverse is a
  very striking head and bust of Clementina, with this inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Clementina, M. Britan., Fr., et Hib. Regina."</p>

  <p>On the reverse is Clementina, driving an ancient chariot towards the
  Colosseum, with this inscription: on the top&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare's Inheritance</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 75.
  154.).&mdash;Probably the following extracts from Littleton's <i>Tenures
  in English, lately perused and amended</i> (1656), may tend to a right
  understanding of the meaning of <i>inheritance</i> and
  <i>purchase</i>&mdash;if so, you may print them:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tenant in fee simple is he which hath lands or tenement to hold to
  him and his heires for ever: and it is called in Latine <i>feodum
  simplex</i>; for <i>feodum</i> is called inheritance, and <i>simplex</i>
  as much to say as lawful or pure, and so <i>feodum simplex</i> is as much
  to say as lawfull or pure inheritance. For if a man will purchase lands
  or tenements in fee simple, it behoveth him to have these words in his
  purchase, To have and to hold unto him and to his heires: for these words
  (his heires) make the estate of inheritance, <i>Anno</i> 10
  <i>Henrici</i> 6. fol. 38.; for if any man purchase lands in these words,
  To have and to hold to him for ever, or by such words, To have and to
  hold to him and to his assigns for ever; in these two cases he hath none
  estate but for terme of life; for that, that he lacketh these words (his
  heires), which words only make the estate of inheritance in all
  feoffements and grants."</p>

  <p>"And it is to be understood that this word (<i>inheritance</i>) is not
  only understood where a man hath lands or tenements by descent of
  heritage, but also every fee simple or fee taile that a man hath by his
  purchase, may be said inheritance; for that, thus his heires may inherite
  them. For in a Writ of Right that a man bringeth of land that was of his
  own purchase, the writ shall say, <i>Quam clamat esse jus et hæreditatem
  suam</i>, this is to say, which he claimeth to be his right and his
  inheritance."</p>

  <p>"Also <i>purchase</i> is called the possession of lands or tenements
  that a man hath by his deed or by his agreement, unto which possession he
  commeth, not by descent of any of his ancestors or of his cosins, but by
  his own deed."</p>

  <p><i>Cassock</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 101. 337.).&mdash;A note in Whalley's
  edition of <i>Ben Jonson</i> has the following remark on this word:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Cassock</i>, in the sense it is here used, is not to be met with
  in our common dictionaries: it signifies a soldier's loose outward coat,
  and is taken in that acceptation by the writers of Jonson's times. Thus
  Shakspeare, in <i>All's Well that Ends Well:</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b2n">

  <p>'Half of the which dare not shake the snow from their
  <i>cassocks</i>.'"</p>

  <p>This is confirmed in the passage of <i>Jonson</i>, on which the above
  is a note.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  He will never come within the sign of it, the sight of a

</blockquote>

  <p>The cassock, as well as the gown and band, seem to have been the usual
  attire of the clergy on all occasions in the last century, as we find

  having come <!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  a tail of the usual length, and this breed continued through several

  <p><i>Names of Slaves</i> (Vol. viii., p. 339.).&mdash;I can answer the
  first of J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;M.'s Queries in the affirmative; it being common to see in
  Virginia slaves, or free people who have been slaves, with names acquired
  in the manner suggested: <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> "Philip Washington," better known
  in Jefferson county as "Uncle Phil.," formerly a slave of the
  Washingtons. A large family, liberated and sent to Cape Palmas, bore the
  surname of "Davenport," from the circumstance that their progenitor had
  been owned by the Davenports. In fact, the practice is almost universal.
  But fancy names are generally used as first names: <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> John
  Randolph, Peyton, Jefferson, Fairfax, Carter, &amp;c. A fine old
  body-servant of Col. Willis was called "Burgundy," <i>shortened</i> into
  "Uncle Gundy." So that "Milton," in the case mentioned, may have been
  merely the homage paid to genius by some enthusiastic admirer of that
  poet.</p>

  <p><i>Solar Annual Eclipse of 1263</i> (Vol. viii., p. 441.).&mdash;Mr.
  Tytler, in the first volume of his <i>History of Scotland</i>, mentions
  that this eclipse, which occurred about 2 <span class="scac">P.M.</span>
  on Sunday, August 5, 1263, has been found by calculation to have been
  actually central and annular to Ronaldsvoe, in the Orkneys, where the
  Norwegian fleet was then lying: a fine example, as he justly adds, "of
  the clear and certain light reflected by the exact sciences on history."
  S. asks, is this eclipse mentioned by any other writer? As connected with
  the Norwegian expedition, it would seem not; but Matthew of Westminster
  (vol. ii. p.&nbsp;408., Bohn's edit.) mentions it having been seen in England,
  although he places it erroneously on the 6th of the month.</p>

  <p><i>Brissot de Warville</i> (Vol. ix., p. 335.).&mdash;Brissot's
  <i>Mémoires</i> is a very common book in the original, and has gone
  through several editions. The passage quoted by N.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;A. was only an
  impudent excuse for an impudent assumption. Brissot, in his early
  ambition, wished to pass himself off as a gentleman, and called himself
  <i>Brissot de Warville</i>, as Danton did D'Anton, and Robespierre de
  Robespierre; but when these worthies were endeavouring to send <i>M. de
  Warville</i> to the scaffold as an aristocrat, he invented this fable of
  his father's having some landed property at <i>Ouarville en Beauce</i>
  (not Beance), and that he was called, according to the custom of the
  country, from this place, where, it seems, he was put out to nurse. When
  the dread of the guillotine made <i>M. de Warville</i> anxious to get rid
  of his aristocratic pretensions, he confessed (in those same
  <i>Mémoires</i>) that his father kept a cook's shop in the town of
  Chartres, and was so ignorant that he could neither read nor write. I
  need not add, that his having had a landed property to justify, in any
  way, the son's territorial appellation, was a gross fiction.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Awkward"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 310.&mdash;H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. has

  noticed the <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  branching off into two forms, signifying different ways of acting wrong;
  one, <i>awkward</i>, implying ignorance and clumsiness; the other,

  tongues. Sir Thomas Browne, whose <i>Hydriotaphia</i> abounds with quaint
  and beautiful allusions to this subject, says, in one place, "Sleep is so
  like death, that I dare not trust him without my prayers:" and he closes
  his learned treatise with the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To live indeed is to be again ourselves; which being not only a hope,
  but an evidence in noble believers, it is all one to lie in St.

  it received a new name from that it most resembled. The proper sign would
  be "The Three Crowns and a Mitre," equivalent to "The Bishop's Arms:" if

  <p><i>Stanza in "Childe Harold"</i> (Vol. viii., p.258.).&mdash;I fear
  that, considering Lord Byron's cacography and carelessness, a reference
  to his MS. would not mend the matter much; as, although the stanza
  undoubtedly contains some errors due to the printer or transcriber for
  the press, the obscurity and unconnected language are his lordship's own,
  and nothing short of a complete recast could improve it materially:
  however, to make the verses such as Byron most probably wrote them, an
  alteration of little more than <i>one letter</i> is required. For
  "wasted," read "washed;" to supply the deficient syllable, insert "yet"
  or "still" after "they," and remove the semicolon in the next line from
  the middle to the end of the verse. Then the stanza runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee;</p>
      <p class="i1">Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, where are they?</p>
      <p>Thy waters wash'd them while they yet were free,</p>
      <p class="i1">And many a tyrant since their shores obey,</p>
      <p>The stranger, slave, or savage&mdash;their decay</p>
      <p class="i1">Has dried up realms to deserts," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sentiment is clear enough, although not well expressed; and the
  use of the present tense, "obey," for "have obeyed," is not at all
  warranted by the usage of our language. In plain prose, it
  means&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thy waters washed their shores while they were independent, and do so
  still, although many a race of tyrants has successively reigned over them
  since then: their decay has converted many fertile regions to
  wildernesses, but thou art still unchanged."</p>

  similar errors. To take those whose works have, perhaps, been oftener
  reprinted than any others of this century, Byron and Scott, the foregoing
  passage in <i>Childe Harold</i> is a signal instance; and as another, the
  Sonnet translated by Byron from Vittorelli, has only had corrected in the
  very latest editions, an error in the punctuation of the first two lines
  which rendered them a mystery to those who did not understand the
  original, as printed on the opposite page. In note 12 to the 5th Canto of
  <i>Marmion</i>, every edition, British or foreign, down to the present
  day, punctuates the last two or three lines as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A torquois ring;&mdash;probably this fatal gift is, with James's
  sword and dagger, preserved in the College of Heralds, London."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Walter is thus made to express a doubt, which he never intended,
  as to the ring being there. A comma after "ring," another after "gift,"
  and the omission of the dash, will restore the true meaning of the
  sentence.</p>

  <p><i>Waugh of Cumberland</i> (Vol. ix., p. 272.).&mdash;John Waugh
  (D.C.L., Feb. 8, 1734)&mdash;born and educated at Appleby, Fellow of
  Queen's College, Oxford; Rector of St. Peter's, Cornhill; Prebendary of
  Lincoln; Dean of Gloucester,&mdash;was consecrated to the See of Carlisle
  Oct. 13, 1723: he died Oct. 1734, and was buried in the church of St.
  Peter, Cornhill. He bore for arms: Arg., on a chevron engrailed gules,
  three bezants.</p>

  <p><i>"Could we with ink," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. viii.
  <i>passim</i>).&mdash;Perhaps one more communication may find admission
  on the above interesting lines. I received from a clerical friend, many
  years ago, a version of them, which differs considerably from that given
  in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;127. The variations I have marked by
  Italics:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Could <i>you</i> with ink the ocean fill,</p>
      <p class="i1"><i>Were the whole world</i> of parchment made,</p>
      <p>Were every <i>single stick</i> a quill,</p>
      <p class="i1">And every man a scribe by trade,</p>
      <p>To write the love of God <i>alone</i>,</p>
      <p class="i1">Would drain the ocean dry,</p>
      <p>Nor could the <i>earth</i> contain the <i>scroll</i>,</p>
      <p class="i1">Though stretch'd from sky to sky."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>My friend did not profess to know who wrote these lines; but he
  understood that they were an attempt to render in English verse a sublime
  passage of the great St. Augustin. It is highly probable that this
  eminent Father was the original author of the passage. It is extremely
  like one of his grand conceptions; but I have hitherto searched his
  voluminous works for it in vain.</p>
